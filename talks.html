                    We communicate a lot through small movements of our facial muscles: Emotional nuance relies on motor
                    nuance.
                    But do we know about the tiny but important movements our facial muscles make? It turns out, we
                    don´t
                    know
                    much! Elisa Filevich and Polina Arbuzova talk about how little we actually know about our own
                    movements
                    (of
                    our face and others) and why it might still be enough. <br><br>

                <p><b>Motor metacognition and agency</b><br>
                    In studies of motor metacognition, we "squeeze" a motor task into an otherwise standard
                    metacognitive
                    paradigm: Participants make a discrimination decision that relates to a movement they just made and
                    then
                    rate confidence in their own decision. I will present two studies using motor metacognitive methods
                    that, I
                    will argue, show how metacognitive methods can bring new perspectives into studies of agency.

                <p><b>"Just Another Tool for Online Studies": An open-source tool to conduct cognitive science
                        experiments
                        online.</b><br>
                    Behavioural data collection for cognitive (neuro)science traditionally takes place in a physical
                    laboratory
                    environment: participants come to the lab, receive carefully delivered instructions from an
                    experimenter
                    and
                    complete a computer-based task. This provides high control over stimuli presentation times and
                    participants’
                    general behaviour, but also comes at a very high cost, because participants spend time travelling to
                    the
                    testing room, and a dedicated experimenter explains the task to each participant and typically stays
                    in
                    the
                    room for the whole duration of the experiment. This naturally sets a limit to the number of
                    participants
                    that can be collected, and is one of the factors contributing to the reproducibility crisis in the
                    field. As
                    an alternative, in cases where only behavioural data are collected, experiments can be conducted
                    online,
                    with participants performing cognitive tasks from their homes and submitting result data through the
                    Internet. This dramatically decreases the time and costs required to collect a full dataset, in turn
                    allowing for larger, more diverse —and thus more representative— samples than the common sample of
                    university students.
                    We have developed an open-source web application to assist in setting up a server for online data
                    collection
                    (JATOS, jatos.org). JATOS supports online studies, including longitudinal and group studies. I will
                    describe the requirements to run a study online, and describe the most common tools available to
                    build
                    and
                    run studies online. I will also give an overview of the advantages and (more importantly),
                    limitations
                    of
                    collecting data online. <br><br>
