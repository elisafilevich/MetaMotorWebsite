			<p>We really, really appreciate your help. In case you're curious about what we're doing with your data,
				here's the elevator pitch:
				<br><br>
				This is a project on <b>Confidence and expectations</b>: Our confidence is supposedly influenced both by
				the current information we are getting, as well as by our expectations.<br>
				If we see something that we are really expecting, we might be extra confident that we saw it. On the
				contrary, if we see something very unexpected, we might be less sure of ourselves.<br>
				We are trying to examine how exactly our decisions and our confidence are influenced by expectations,
				and how much we rely on expectations compared to incoming information. <br>
				We use behavioural methods (using a gameified task) to examine this.
				<br><br>
				We hope to finish data collection this fall, and start working on a manuscript soon (&#129310;).
				Thank you for taking part in our study, we can't do it without you!
